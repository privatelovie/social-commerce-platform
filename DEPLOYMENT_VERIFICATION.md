# Deployment Verification Guide

## üöÄ Auto-Deployment Status

Your changes have been pushed to GitHub and should automatically trigger deployments on:
- **Railway** (Backend) - Usually takes 3-5 minutes
- **Vercel** (Frontend) - Usually takes 2-3 minutes

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Backend Deployment (Railway)

### Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Find your social-commerce-ai-platform backend project
3. Click on **Deployments** tab
4. Look for the latest deployment (commit: `01d3700`)
5. Wait for status to show **"Success"** (green checkmark)

### Test Backend Health Endpoint
Once deployment succeeds, test your backend:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway URL
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-..."
}
```

### Check Railway Logs (if issues occur)
```bash
railway logs --tail
```

Or view logs in Railway dashboard under the **Logs** tab.

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Verify Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

### Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your social-commerce-platform project
3. Click on **Deployments**
4. Look for the latest deployment (commit: `01d3700`)
5. Wait for status to show **"Ready"** (green)

### Important: Production Domain
Vercel should be using the production domain. If you see the deployment URL, click on it to visit your site.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Clear Browser Cache

**This is critical!** Old JavaScript/CSS files may be cached.

### Windows:
- **Chrome/Edge:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` ‚Üí Select "Cached Images and Files" ‚Üí Clear

### Alternative (Hard Reset):
1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Test New Features

### 4.1 Dark Mode (Default)
- [x] Open the website
- [x] **Verify dark background** (#0f0f0f) is default

- [x] Click to switch to light mode
- [x] Refresh page - should remember your preference

### 4.2 Logout Button
- [x] Click logout button (red logout icon in desktop navigation)
- [x] Should redirect to landing page (not /login)
- [x] Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage
- [x] Verify all storage is cleared
- [x] Try logging back in - should work normally

### 4.3 Clickable Hashtags
- [x] View any post in the feed
- [x] Hashtags should be **blue** and **clickable**
- [x] Hover over hashtag - should show **underline**
- [x] Click hashtag - check console for log message
- [x] (Future: will navigate to hashtag explorer)

### 4.4 Product Images

- Upload a video file (MP4, max 100MB)
- Add title, description, hashtags
- Search and link a product

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Check for Issues

### Open Browser Console
Press `F12` and check for:

#### ‚ùå Common Errors to Look For:

**CORS Errors:**
```
Access to fetch at 'https://backend.railway.app/api/...' from origin 'https://frontend.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Fix:** Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway environment variables matches your Vercel URL exactly.

**Authentication Errors:**
```
401 Unauthorized
JWT token invalid
```

**Fix:** Check if you're logged in. Try logging out and back in.

**Socket.IO Connection Errors:**
```
WebSocket connection failed
Socket.IO connection error
```

**Fix:** Check Socket.IO CORS settings in backend and verify SOCKET_URL environment variable.

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret      # From Google Cloud Console
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app     # Must match Vercel URL exactly
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Frontend (Vercel)
