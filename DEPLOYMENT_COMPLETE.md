## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Responding
```bash
# Check Railway logs
1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Click your project
3. Click "View Logs"
4. Look for errors

# Test endpoint directly
curl https://socialcommerce-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

### Frontend Not Loading
```bash
# Check Vercel logs
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click latest deployment
5. View logs

# Check browser console
F12 → Console → Look for errors
```

### User Search Returns Nothing
- **Issue**: No users in database yet
- **Fix**: Register multiple test accounts first

### Follow Button Not Working
- **Issue**: Not logged in OR backend endpoint issue
- **Fix**: 
  1. Verify you're logged in (token in localStorage)
  2. Check Network tab for 401/500 errors
  3. Verify backend endpoint: `POST /api/users/:username/follow`

### Logout Not Redirecting
- **Issue**: Route not configured
- **Fix**: Make sure `/login` route exists in your app

### Images Not Loading
- **Issue**: Avatar URLs might be broken
- **Fix**: Uses fallback DiceBear API avatars automatically

## 📊 Database Seeding (Optional)

To test with real data, create test users:

```javascript
// In MongoDB or via API
// Create 5-10 test users with:
{
  username: "testuser1",
  email: "test1@example.com",
  password: "password123",
  displayName: "Test User 1",
  isCreator: true,
  isVerified: true,
  profile: {
    bio: "This is a test user account",
    avatar: "https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/avataaars/svg?seed=testuser1"
  }
}
```

Or register manually via the UI at `/login`
