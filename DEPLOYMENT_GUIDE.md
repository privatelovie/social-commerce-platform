### Issue: User search not working
**Fix**: Verify API endpoint is correct:
- Should be: `GET /api/users?q=<query>`
- Not: `GET /api/users/search`

### Issue: Logout not redirecting
**Fix**: Check that `authAPI.logout()` is called and token is cleared

### Issue: Follow button not updating
**Fix**: Verify backend endpoint:
- `POST /api/users/:username/follow`
- Should toggle follow/unfollow

### Issue: Environment variables not working
**Fix**: 
1. Check Vercel dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
